# CalendarSync
One way sync from Outlook to Google Calendar

This is a combination of the Google Calendat API [.NET Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/dotnet) and some example code on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/92184/2277) with some code of my own to merge items from Outlook to Google Calendar.
